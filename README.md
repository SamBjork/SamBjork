<h2 align="center"> Hello World, SamBjork here! 👋 </h2>

- ⌨ I’m currently working on: Developing devices for IoT and making a UI for the current project. Developing the website for MBIT AB, also some hobby projects including a React Native app.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my thesis on a comparisson between Python and the Anvil Works tool and .Net/ Blazor.
- 📫 You can reach me at: samuel.bjorkqvist@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was driving an ice cream truck and aiming to become an actor before I realized the developer path could be a nice one to walk.
- 🥅 My main goals are to finish my fullstack education and when the time is right, start my own company.
