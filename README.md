<h2 align="center"> Hello World, SamBjork here! 👋 </h2>

- ⌨ I’m currently working on: Developing the website mbitgbg.se, also developing some hobby projects including a Xamarin app my WebApp JobSearchAssistant.
- 🌱 I’m currently working part-time for MBIT i Göteborg AB along with working on my hobby projects.
- 📫 You can reach me at: samuel.bjorkqvist@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was driving an ice cream truck and aiming to become an actor before I realized the developer path could be a nice one to walk.
- 🥅 My main goals are to get a fun and fulfilling job and in time become a tech lead, scrum master and on the side launch my own apps and services.
